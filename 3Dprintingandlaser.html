<p><strong>How I did it:</strong></p>
<p>Since I am traveling in Italy without access to a laser cutter or 3D printer I thought I'd get as far as I can with the projet up to pressing print. I created my 3D + Laser files for the 3D printer and cardboard using a combination of Rhino, Grasshopper. Here are the basics of what I did with screen shots to follow.</p>
<p>First thing I did was to measure out the lamp I purchased. Then I measured out some cardboard (3.8 mm) I found in Italy so I had something to reference. I got my inspiration from a combination of places. One was an image of a lamp that Nadya showed in her presentation: <a>https://bit.ly/2Wew8C6/</a> also at <a href="https://schneid.org/">https://schneid.org/</a> The other source of inspiration came from Nathan Melinbrink: <a>https://bit.ly/2V0lZMM/</a> I was fond of Nathan's floor lamp type treatment but it seemed complicated to have each panel attached to two spines so I used the lamp that Nady showed as inspiration to build panels that just used one notch. </p>
<p>To do this I made a basic shape of a curved line that would eventually become the outline or inner scaffolding of the lamp shade. I revolved this shape and made sure that the outside shaded shape measured to the size I needed to fit my lamp insides. Next I came up with a shape with the panels. At best I would describe this shape as a trapezoid with rounded corners. I placed that shape in a bounding box and used the Grasshopper console set up that Nadya showed us in class ( <a href="https://bit.ly/2Wew8C6">https://bit.ly/2Wew8C6/</a> ) to tell Rhino that I wanted to apply that shape to the side of my lamp scaffolding. Then I used the number sliders to control the height and with of those panels which essentially controlled how many panels I would have to print in the end. Once I had the amount of panels I needed set them as surfaces and brought the shapes in to Illustrator, added a notch to them and repeated the shapes over and over so that I would have the correct amount necessary to print. </p>
<p>After setting up the panels I realized that they along with the spine would not be enough to hold everything together so I decided to make two inner circles that the spines could attach to. One for the top and one for the bottom. To do this I measured the diameter of the inside of both the top and bottom of the lampshade. I created the circular shapes in illustrator and brought them along with the notch shape in to Rhino so I could apply an ArrayPolar to the notches essentially rotating and copying a total of ten notches — one for each spine. Once finished with these circles I exported both top and bottom back in to the illustrator file that I created for the panels. </p>
<p>Once the circles were finished I started working on the spine pieces. These I decided would be printed on the 3D printer. For this I made two spine shapes in Illustrator — one with the notches taken out and one without notches. While I suspect I'll have to use the spine with notches I thought it would be nice to see if I could keep the panels in place without. </p>
<p>To create the 3D file I brought the two shapes in to Rhino. I copied the shapes and moved them the same distance of the thickness of my cardboard (3.8 mm).&nbsp; I then used the Loft command to connect the two pieces after which I applied the Cap command to make them have top and bottom surfaces. </p>
<p>So with all my panel shapes and circles in Illustrator and the spines in Rhino I have everything ready to print. </p>
<p>Thankfully Nadya posted a link to video that was made to walk us through the steps: <a href="https://bit.ly/2Wew8C6/">https://bit.ly/2Wew8C6/</a></p>

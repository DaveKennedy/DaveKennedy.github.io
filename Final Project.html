<div><strong>Wooden Wallet</strong> — Walnut wallet with 3D Printed PLA initials</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Final Project</strong></p>
<p data_temp_dwid="1">For my final project I used a combination of OnShape, Rhino, Interlocking Parts, CNC Milling, Laser Cutter, and the 3D Printer to make a wooden wallet with slightly rounded edges and initials as a birthday present for a friend. To create this I started with OnShape to design all the sides of the wooden wallet so they will press fit together. Once I was finished I exported the shapes as DXF so I could open them in Illustrator. From Illustrator I was able to send my files to the Laser Cutter. After making a couple adjustments to the file measurements each piece press fit together to make the wallet. Next I made two files for the initials RM in Illustrator. One file was essentially a thicker version of the initials and one was a thin version of the initials. The thick version would be used to cut a toolpath of the letters halfway through the walmut wood on the Bantam CNC Mill. The thin version would be printed out on a 3D Printer and later inlayed into the milled recession. Lastly I sanded the wallet and finished it off with an oil rub.  <br data_temp_dwid="2">

<div>Mill Initials. I ended up running the toolpath twice. Once with a 1/32" flat head mill and then again with a 1/64" flat head mill using the same toolpath</div>

<div>Create thin version of letters. To do this I measured the current height of the Illustrator file (14.5mm) and subtracted the height I wanted it to be (13mm) and from the height of my caliper measurements (1.5mm) Then I doubled this number (3mm) and added that much stroke to the letters. Then I selected the letters and outlined the stroke under Object/Path/Outline Stroke. This creates several paths that make up the excess letter that you can delete until you have the size letter you desire. </div>

<div>Import the letters in to Rhino. Once imported I measured the depth of my recession (2mm) created on the mill, confirmed the length letters in Rhino, and&nbsp; extruded the shape to 1.875mm. I put a cap on it and exported the .stl file so I could open it in Dremel DigiLab 3D Slicer.</div>

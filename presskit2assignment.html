<p><strong>How I did it:</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost — OMG! Okay now that I have that out of the way. I created my pressk kit files for cardboard and paper using Rhino and Grasshopper this time and the learning curve on this one for me was HUGE. But I did it! Yes! So here are the basics of what I did with screen shots to follow.. </p>
<p>First thing I did was to measure out my initial Illustrator shapes from Assignment 1 since I liked the size of those. Then I started building the individual components that would make up those shapes in Rhino using mostly Grasshopper to create them. Then I got lost! So I watched a bunch of YouTube Videos (ABOUT 6 HOURS) and they were great but even the most basic ones didn’t really show me how to make adjstable notches and repeat shapes in the way that we learned in class. </p>
<p>Thankfully Nadya posted a link to video that was made to walk us through the steps: <a href="https://bit.ly/2Iv9fa9">https://bit.ly/2Iv9fa9</a></p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU NADYA!</strong></p>
<p>Using Grasshopper I basically created several different sized overlapping rectangles and moved them into a position that matched my original vector file in Illustrator. I set the rectangles that I would be using for notches up so that their width and length are adjustable and used the ArrayPolar command to repeat the shapes and put them in to place so I could Trim them out. </p>
<p>Once I had all the shapes in to place I measured the thickness of my paper and cardboard and used the number sliders connected to my components in Grasshopper to set the thickness. </p>
<p>Cardboard thickness = 4.04 mm</p>
<p>Paper thickness = .055 mm </p>
<p>Once the thickness was set up I selected all my components in Grasshopper and Baked them. This allowed me to commit the shapes to Rhino so I could trim them and eventually duplicate them. For the most part I was able to make the shapes look exactly like I wanted however trimming them was much more complicated this time around. For whatever reason Rhino didn’t like the shapes I created so in some cases I had to create new shapes to use as trimming devices. Not a problem but definitely slowed down my process. </p>
<p>Next I copied and pasted all the shapes to get the exact number I wanted and selected the group and exported selected files to Illustrator so that I could print it to the laser cutter. Once the file loaded up on the laser printer I made sure my vector lines were set to .001pt, set the speed power and frequency and ran the job with the lid open to make sure it ‘looked’ I it was going to cut correctly. </p>
<p>Once everything looked right I ran the job with the lid closed and the cuts were a success!</p>
<p>Cardboard speed power and frequence = 50 50 100</p>
<p>Paper speed power and frequency = 50 40 100</p>
<p>Special thanks to Michael Hsieh who helped me trouble shoot some cutting problems I had and Jamie Odell for Laser printing tips.</p>

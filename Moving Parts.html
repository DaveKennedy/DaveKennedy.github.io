<div><strong>Moving Parts</strong> — Individual cardboard parts</div>
<p><strong>How I did it:</strong></p>
<p>I started by watching Joshua's tutorial video: <a>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WNmtTMGzSM517SliSAqm0r8SVZxWn9Mb</a> Next I found inspiration from 507 Movements: <a>http://507movements.com/mm_325.html</a> I made all the guidelines in OnShape construction geometry. Then I started building the shapes. After several rounds of trying to get the dimensions right I added dimensions to it, made adjustments to the similar spaces and then exported a DWG file so I could print from Illustrator on to cardboard using the laser. </p>
<p>To make it move I glue the arms to a cut out of the circle on the two horizontal pieces shown above. </p>

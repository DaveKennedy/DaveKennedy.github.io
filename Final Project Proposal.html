<div><strong>Wooden Wallet with 3D Printed Inlay</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Concept:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For my final project I’ll use a combination of OnShape, Rhino, CNC Milling, and the 3D Printer to make a wooden wallet with rounded edges and an initial or logo inlay as a birthday present for a friend. To create this I would use OnShape to design all the sides of the wooden wallet so they will press fit together and eventually glued for permanence. To cut these shapes and create the space for the inlay I’ll use CNC Milling. Then I’ll use Rhino to design and create the inlay/logo that will printed on the 3D printer and later glued in to the inlay space on the wallet. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Tasks/Timeline: </strong></p>
  <p>5.21 — Order Materials (Wood &amp; Black 3D Printer Filament) </p>
  <p>5.24 — Measure, Sketch and Design Wallet and Logo </p>
  <p>5.25 — Transfer Sketches and Designs of the Wallet and Logo into OnShape and Rhino, respectively. </p>
  <p>5.31 — CNC Mill Wallet Parts including space for inlay. </p>
  <p>5.31 — 3D Print Initial/Logo </p>
  <p>6.01 — Put Wallet Parts together, glue for permanence, round corners with sander, and sand entire wallet. </p>
  <p>6.01 — Glue in Initial/Logo inlay. </p>
  <p>6.07 — Hand in Assignment </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Bill of Materials:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thin Lumber Board (1/8” x 3” x 18”) — $4.95 </p>
  <p>3D Printer Filament (Black) — $19.99 </p>
  <p>Glue — Already have</p>
  <p>Tape — Already have </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Contingency plans: </strong></p>
  <p>There are local places to order materials or the wallet is small enough that I could probable use scrap materials from lab. If something goes wrong with my design or I don’t know how to do something plead for help. ; ) </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Stretch Goals:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Laser cut smaller initials and animal shape on wallet. </p>

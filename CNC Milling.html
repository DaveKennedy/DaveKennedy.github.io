<div><strong>Individual parts </strong>— OnShape </div>
<p><strong>How I did it:</strong></p>
<p>I found inspiration from a wooden business card holder I found online: <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/creategiftlove/product/wood-business-card-holder-man-gun-bear-design/">https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/creategiftlove/product/wood-business-card-holder-man-gun-bear-design</a> I made all the parts for my wallet in OnShape: <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3c6395cdf35d409c322df474/w/ee3666db464d816dec63951e/e/5fb773904b365f92aa401c81">https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3c6395cdf35d409c322df474/w/ee3666db464d816dec63951e/e/5fb773904b365f92aa401c81</a>. I started building my shapes and after several rounds of trying to get the shapes right I added dimensions to it, made adjustments. created some parts, and then exported a DXF file so I could open my files in KiCand and plot my files. Once I had the files opened KiCad I plotted them so I could open them up on BantamTools. From there I sent the files to the CNC router to so I could cut the shapes out of FR1 and then press them together.</p>
<p>Special Thanks to Ani Ganesh and Andrew Waer for helping me with the Router.</p>
